		\frametitle{Thymeflow and SPARQL}
    Thymeflow is a Knowledge Base meant using the RDF specification for its data.
    ~\\
    These graphs are meant to be used with the SPARQL query language.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item [Exemples SPARQL]
    \end{itemize}
    ~\\
    SPARQL can be complex and is not appropriate in the case of non-expert users, hence requires a user interface.

    \frametitle{A controlled query language: SQUALL}
    Based on Squall project by Sebastien Ferr√© (Inria Rennes).

    Goal:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Have a simpler query language
      \item This language has to be (at least nearly) as expressive as SPARQL
    \end{itemize}
    ~\\
    SQUALL is a candidate:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item How many Person are an author of the book whose title is "Web Data" ?
      \item What is a Book ?
    \end{itemize}

    \frametitle{Conclusion}
    Some work is still to do :
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Add logical operators (\texttt{and}, \texttt{or}, \texttt{not})
      \item Add variables (\texttt{?A}) to gain expressiveness
      \item Add more synonyms to get closer to natural language
    \end{itemize}
